# Forecasting Electricity Consumption using ARIMA and Prophet  

This repository contains the notebook **AimaAndProphetStreamlit.ipynb**, where we analyze electricity consumption data across multiple clients.  
We apply **ARIMA** and **Prophet** forecasting models, compare their performance, and draw meaningful conclusions about their strengths and weaknesses.

## ðŸ”„ Machine Learning Life Cycle  
1. **Data Upload** â€“ Import and extract the dataset into the environment.  
2. **Data Understanding** â€“ Explore dataset structure, variables, and relationships.  
3. **Data Preparation & Cleaning** â€“ Handle missing values, outliers, and resampling.  
4. **Modelling** â€“ Apply ARIMA and Prophet models to selected client time series.  
5. **Evaluation & Comparison** â€“ Compare ARIMA vs Prophet using MAE, RMSE, and MAPE.  
6. **Conclusions** â€“ Discuss which model works better and under which conditions.
